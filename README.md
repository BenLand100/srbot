# ScapeRune Bot

Jupyter notebooks contain scripts that use the srbot Python library to automate
tasks in RuneScape servers circa 2006. Originally written for Scaperune
and now targeted at 2006Rebotted.

# Setup

Strongly recommended to run RuneScape in a VNC session and set the DISPLAY
varible to the VNC display. This code uses the system mouse and keyboard.

# Usage

Create `creds.py` with a `username` and `password` field for your account to 
enable logging in. Using some nominally complete Jupyter installation (e.g.
Anaconda), open one of the notebooks and run the cells to run the script.
